{"name":"SMXTwitterEngine","body":"After being annoyed by the complexity of other Twitter libraries for iOS, I built this. It only\r\nsupports posting a Tweet, and I've no intention of supporting the other capabilities in Twitter.\r\n\r\nIt uses iOS5's Twitter framework when running on a device that supports it, but falls back\r\nto good a old fashioned UIWebView if the device is running 4.x or there are no Twitter accounts\r\nconfigured in iOS.\r\n\r\nIf you only want to use it on iOS5, it's really simple:\r\n\r\n``` objc\r\n[SMXTwitterEngine sendTweet:@\"This is a tweet\" withCompletionHandler:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error){\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Response: %@\", response);\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Error: %@\", error);\r\n}];\r\n```\r\n\r\nWant to attach an image? Easy:\r\n\r\n``` objc\r\n[SMXTwitterEngine sendTweet:@\"This is a tweet\" andImage:myImage withCompletionHandler:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error){\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Response: %@\", response);\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Error: %@\", error);\r\n}];\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're planning on running on devices running 4.x, you'll also need:\r\n\r\n``` objc\r\n[SMXTwitterEngine setConsumerKey:@\"KEY\" consumerSecret:@\"SECRET\" callback:@\"CALLBACK\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to get your consumer key, consumer secret and callback set up [here](http://dev.twitter.com/apps). \r\nDon't forget to make the application \"Read & Write\".\r\n\r\nWould you rather use a Tweet Sheet on iOS 5 if possible? Easy:\r\n\r\n``` objc\r\n[SMXTwitterEngine setUseTweetComposeSheetIfPossible:YES];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using a Tweet sheet will return an empty NSDictionary to your completion handler, since iOS doesn't make any\r\ninformation about the posted tweet available.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nFirst, grab the submodules:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, drag the SMXTwitterEngine Xcode project into your project. Add libSMXTwitterEngine as a dependency,\r\nand make sure to link against it.\r\n\r\nAdd -ObjC and -all_load to your \"Other Linker Flags\".\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to link against Twitter.framework and Accounts.framework. If you plan to support iOS 4.x, you'll\r\nneed to make sure those are optional frameworks (weakly linked).\r\n\r\nAdd \"SMXTwitterEngine\" to your Header Search Paths, and then make sure that THWebController.bundle is in your \r\n\"Copy Bundle Resources\" Build Phase.\r\n\r\nFinally:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n#import <libSMXTwitterEngine/SMXTwitterEngine.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you're good to go!\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nHave a look at the example project for a working demo.\r\n\r\n## ARC\r\n\r\nAs much as I'd love to use ARC, requiring iOS 4.0 support means I can't :(\r\nSMXTwitterEngine does, however, still work in an ARC enabled application.\r\n\r\n## iOS 3\r\n\r\nSince iOS 3 doesn't support blocks, it is currently not supported.
